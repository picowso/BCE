# BCE Todo List:

[X] Remove Board from being global and pass by reference instead

[ ] Optimize MG (move/unmove instead of storing boards!)

[ ] Implement UCI move notation (a-z)(1-8)(a-z)(1-8)[PAWN PROMO] 

[ ] Implement UCI and hook it up with Lichess

[ ] Implement BitBoard representation

[ ] Use a NNUE/NN/MLP/something instead of the hand-made evaluation function, a good dataset for this might be +3000 lichess rapid games.
